# A 3D printable screwdriver bit for a step drill
It's a screwdriver bit that allows you to attach a step drill so you don't need a power tool. I used it to drill a 1/2 inch hold for some [airtight filament canisters](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1332650) for my filament spools. I had this step drill bought on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Bosch-SDH1-Speed-Steel-Drill/dp/B000CFNBDQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1481048751&sr=8-4&keywords=1%2F2+step+drill), along with a regular screwdriver.
